# DSI Analytics Platform

DSI is a full-stack business intelligence application. The React frontend lets
users connect or upload data, explore dashboards, generate reports, and query
their data. The Python backend owns ingestion, deterministic analytics, secure
connector storage, sharing, PDF export, and optional AI/voice integrations.

## Technology

- Frontend: React 19, Vite 8, React Router, Recharts, PapaParse, SheetJS
- Backend: Python, Uvicorn, pandas, NumPy, scikit-learn, Matplotlib
- Storage: PostgreSQL analytics warehouse in production; isolated SQLite fallback for local development
- Delivery: Cloudflare Workers and GitHub Actions configuration

Generated folders such as `node_modules/`, `.venv/`, `dist/`, `tmp/`, logs,
Python bytecode, and local databases are intentionally excluded from Git.

## Local setup

Requirements: Node.js 22+ and Python 3.12+.

```powershell
npm ci
python -m venv .venv
.\.venv\Scripts\python -m pip install -r backend\requirements.txt
Copy-Item .env.example .env
npm run dev
```

The frontend runs through Vite and the backend listens on
`http://127.0.0.1:8000`. Set `PYTHON` before `npm run dev` if the desired Python
executable is not available as `python`.

## Commands

| Command | Purpose |
| --- | --- |
| `npm run dev` | Run frontend and backend together |
| `npm run frontend` | Run only the Vite frontend |
| `npm run backend` | Run only the Python API |
| `npm run test:backend` | Run backend contract tests |
| `npm run lint` | Lint JavaScript and JSX source |
| `npm run build` | Build the production frontend |
| `npm run verify` | Run tests, lint, and production build |

## Configuration and data safety

Copy `.env.example` to `.env` and fill only the integrations you use. Never
commit `.env`, `backend/data/`, connector keys, session keys, or SQLite files.
Existing local data is preserved during normal cleanup.

## Database-first analytics

Uploaded CSV/Excel and other supported structured files follow this path:

1. The original file is committed to workspace-scoped storage before analysis.
2. The source is parsed once; PostgreSQL uses `COPY` to bulk-load every parsed row.
3. A deterministic dashboard (schema, quality, KPIs, filters, and charts) is returned immediately.
4. Advanced ML and report enrichment continue in a bounded background worker and update the same session.
5. Cells are normalized into domain-neutral numeric, date, dimension, and quality fields.
6. Only the static, parameterized query catalog can read analytical evidence.
7. The AI receives a bounded JSON summary of aggregates, top dimensions, date coverage, and data quality. Raw rows, identifiers, and sensitive column values are excluded.

Set `DATABASE_URL` to a PostgreSQL connection string in production. If it is
empty, local development uses `backend/data/analytics_warehouse.sqlite3` (or
`BYIZON_SQLITE_ANALYTICS_PATH`) with the same query contract.
`BYIZON_BACKGROUND_WORKERS` controls advanced-analysis concurrency (default `2`;
keep it between `1` and `4`). No API key is required for parsing, SQL analysis,
the quick dashboard, or background processing. `HF_API_KEY` remains optional.
